# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Set the project domain/slug to `techmarket-digital` and deploy the latest frontend and backend canisters live to the Internet Computer mainnet.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the app’s deployment/project configuration to use the domain/slug value `techmarket-digital` and ensure it passes platform validation rules.
- Deploy (“push live”) the current frontend and backend canisters to IC mainnet.
- Record the resulting live URL and the deployed frontend/backend canister IDs in `frontend/DEPLOYED_MAINNET.md`.

**User-visible outcome:** The app is accessible via the newly configured `techmarket-digital` project domain/slug on IC mainnet, and deployment details (live URL + canister IDs) are documented.
